        <p>Daily Milage: 50 Miles a Day</p>
        <p>Winner of a National Geographic Adventures '50 Tours of a Lifetime' Award! From Seattle, Washington to East Glacier National Park, Montana, this Epic trip combines portions of three of our favorite tours - the Washington Epic, Idaho's Selkirk Loop and a chunk of the Glacier National Park tours – spinning through three states and finishing with a one-of-a-kind train ride. Take on the Cascade, Selkirk and even the Rocky Mountain ranges as you spin through this 700-mile, 10-day extravaganza. On arrival in Whitefish, Montana, hop aboard Amtrak's Empire Builder train, with private sleeping cars - and head right on back to Seattle.</p></div>
